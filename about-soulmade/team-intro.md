# ðŸ‘» SoulMade Intro

SoulMade is the first composable NFT platform where everyone can unleash their creativity, itâ€™s a platform owned by artists, creators, and collectors.

As original digital artworks creating artists, you can sell your unique designs in the form of 2D and 3D arts, music, or videos with a direct sale.

As creators, you can also explore the artworks in your own way, and recreate them as your own art project.

And as collectors, you will discover different art displays and secondary creations from global artists and creators, and sell and buy them on our marketplace.

2D images will be our starting point, and more media formats will be added along the way. We believe that everyone has a creative mind, and you can make it valuable and profitable.
